      <description>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at IBM Research Labs in India. My work primarily involves developing artificial conversational agents that can understand and participate in natural language dialogue. I am interested in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing applications and have experience working on problems in both fields. I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 2018 with a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering and a minor in Cognitive Science.</description>
